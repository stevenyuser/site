Hi, I'm Steven Yu! Iâ€™m a computer science student at Cornell University, passionate about building cool stuff and solving interesting problems. I'm an avid learner, which naturally led me to the huge and ever-changing field of computer science. I really love developing projects and tinkering with technology, which you can check out [here](/projects).

I've been fascinated by computer science since taking AP Computer Science A in high school! Since then, I've delved deep into the world of computer science, particularly in software engineering. I especially love developing iOS apps using Swift/SwiftUI. I'm also experienced in web development, whether it be front-end or back-end. Aside from software engineering, I'm also interested in the field of computer architecture.

Outside of computer science, I like learning about history, listening to music, watching movies, and watching basketball.

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my socials!
