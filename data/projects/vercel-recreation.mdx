I saw this cool section on the [Vercel landing page](https://vercel.com/), where
whenever you hovered your mouse over a framework icon, the text would update and the icon would be colored as well.

I thought it would be good practice to recreate that section by myself in React and TailwindCSS, so I did!

It proved to be really useful, because it gave me more practice with TailwindCSS and CSS in general. I learned more about TailwindCSS's support for responsive design (support for mobile), animations, and more.
